# Testing & Database Migration

## Testing Strategy (TDD Approach)
To ensure high quality and maintainability, we will adopt a Test-Driven Development (TDD) mindset where applicable.

### Backend Testing (ASP.NET Core)
- **Unit Tests**: Using xUnit and Moq.
- **Integration Tests**: Using WebApplicationFactory.

### Frontend Testing (React)
- **Unit & Integration Tests**: Using Jest and React Testing Library.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Using a framework like Cypress or Playwright.

## Database Migration Strategy
- **Technology**: Entity Framework Core Migrations. We will use the dotnet ef command-line tools to generate and apply migrations in a code-first workflow, ensuring the database schema is version-controlled and deployed automatically.
